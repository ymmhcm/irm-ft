She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?\n\nStep 1: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours. Eliza's hourly rate is $10, so her earnings for the first 40 hours are $10/hour x 40 hours = $400.\nStep 2: Calculate Eliza's overtime pay rate. Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is $10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour.\nStep 3: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the overtime hours. Eliza worked for 45 hours, so her overtime hours are 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her earnings for the overtime hours are $12/hour x 5 hours = $60.\nStep 4: Calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week. Eliza's total earnings for the week are her earnings for the first 40 hours plus her earnings for the overtime hours, which is $400 + $60 = $460.\n\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{{\\text{{460}}}}\n\nquestion:\n{question}\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line at the end in the form \"\\boxed{{\\text{{$ANSWER}}}}\" (without quotes), where $ANSWER is replaced by the actual answer to the problem.\n",
