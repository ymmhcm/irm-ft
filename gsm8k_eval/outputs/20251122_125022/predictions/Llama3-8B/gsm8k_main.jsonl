Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 miles/hour x 4 = 12 miles/hour.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Dana's walking speed. Since Dana can run at 12 miles/hour and skip at 3 miles/hour, her walking speed is 3 miles/hour / 4 = 0.75 miles/hour.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time spent running and walking. Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, the time spent running is 6 hours x 1/3 = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is 6 hours x 2/3 = 4 hours.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the distance traveled running and walking. The distance traveled running is 12 miles/hour x 2 hours = 24 miles, and the distance traveled walking is 0.75 miles/hour x 4 hours = 3 miles.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total distance traveled.
