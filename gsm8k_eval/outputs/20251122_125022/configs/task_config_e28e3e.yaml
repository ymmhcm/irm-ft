      Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response
      should display the answer enclosed within \boxed{{\text{{$ANSWER}}}}.


      Example:


      Let''s solve the problem step by step.


      Problem: Eliza''s rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is
      $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
      If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?


      Step 1: Calculate Eliza''s earnings for the first 40 hours. Eliza''s hourly
      rate is $10, so her earnings for the first 40 hours are $10/hour x 40 hours
      = $400.

      Step 2: Calculate Eliza''s overtime pay rate. Eliza''s overtime pay rate is
      1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is $10/hour x 1.2
      = $12/hour.

      Step 3: Calculate Eliza''s earnings for the overtime hours. Eliza worked for
      45 hours, so her overtime hours are 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her earnings
      for the overtime hours are $12/hour x 5 hours = $60.

      Step 4: Calculate Eliza''s total earnings for the week. Eliza''s total earnings
      for the week are her earnings for the first 40 hours plus her earnings for the
      overtime hours, which is $400 + $60 = $460.
